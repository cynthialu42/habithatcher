# Habit Hatcher

Do you know what an egg and a habit have in common? 
It takes 21 days to hatch both!
Habit Hatcher is a proof of concept gamified habit tracker that makes sticking to your goals fun!

Design studies have shown that people are drawn to random chance games (ex. slots) and also collecting games (ex. Pokemon Go, Cat Collector,etc). 
Habit Hatcher aims to draw upon these concepts to make completing your goals and turning them into habits something to look forward to.

# How it works
- Users are presented a simple form to add their goals, how often they should complete the goal daily, and any additional notes.
- Upon submission, users are taken to the home page, where each habit has been assigned a random egg that will hatch randomly as the user increments and complete the goal. Once the daily goal is complete, the buttons to increment will grey out.
- More information about the habit can be found clicking on the 'i' on the egg
- The Aviary tab will display hatched eggs, and the progress of hatching eggs
- Clicking on the bird/egg will reveal the habit it hatched from, and some bird wisdom
